                  What is laser hair removal?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Laser hair removal is a non-invasive treatment that uses concentrated light to target hair follicles.
                  The pigment in the follicles absorbs the light, which damages the follicle and inhibits future hair
                  growth. It's a long-lasting solution for unwanted hair.

                  Is laser hair removal painful?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Most clients describe the sensation as a mild pinching or warm feeling. Discomfort levels vary
                  depending on the treatment area and individual pain tolerance. Our advanced laser technology includes
                  cooling features to minimize discomfort during treatment.

                  How many sessions will I need?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Most clients require 6-8 sessions for optimal results, spaced 4-6 weeks apart. This is because hair
                  grows in cycles, and the laser is most effective on hair in the active growth phase. Maintenance
                  sessions may be needed periodically after the initial treatment course.

                  What should I do before my laser hair removal appointment?
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Avoid sun exposure for at least 2 weeks before treatment. Shave the treatment area 24 hours before
                  your appointment (but don't wax or pluck). Avoid applying lotions, creams, or deodorants to the area
                  on the day of treatment. Wear loose, comfortable clothing.
